Research Summary 
TODDE is a cybersecurity research project focused on developing personalized deception strategies to proactively defend against cyber attacks. By analyzing attacker personality traits, TODDE predicts their next moves and deploys customized deception tactics, such as AI-powered honeypots that adaptively respond to attacker behavior, making the deception more realistic and effective. This dynamic framework combines psychological insights, advanced AI, and machine learning to enhance cybersecurity defenses through targeted, adaptive deception.

Research Summary 
We are working to unveil the privacy and security hurdles within the education technology (edtech) landscape in regards to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The first stretch of research has uncovered the challenges that HEIs face during the acquisition process of these edtechs.
Our first study, uncovered the EdTech acquisition process in the HEI context including the consideration of security and privacy issues throughout that process, the pain points of HEI personnel in establishing adequate protection mechanisms in service contracts, and their struggle in holding vendors accountable due to a lack of visibility into their system and power-asymmetry, among other reasons.
Continued research involves understanding the differing technologies that faculty use at HEIs that are unsanctioned by their institutions to uncover any privacy and security concerns that are involved.

Research Summary 
We are developing an automated pipeline that interacts with Android applications while monitoring their behavior. Our research provides more granular insight than prior works into how apps access and transmit users' sensitive data. Additionally, we aim to investigate whether apps handle user information differently across various geolocations.
