## Privacy and Security of Technology Ecosystems in Higher Education Institutes
Higher education institutes (HEIs) are quickly becoming complex ecosystems of various computing technologies handling diverse data pertaining to teaching, research, lifestyles and mobility in campus, health and finances, and immigration status. These technologies and services are provided by, in most cases, third-party for-profit vendors, and their integration creates complex ecosystems that often lack transparency and auditability, as identified in our recent paper. This opaque collection of systems, and data flows among them, which can not be monitored by HEI personnel, creates a lot of opportunities for privacy invasion as well as safety and welbeing of the data subjects. Simultenously, the massive amounts of data these technologies collect are making HEis lucrative targets for cyber attackers.

Our research is sheding light on this emerging problems through qualitative explorations, as well as developing tools and frameworks for identifying and quantifying privacy and security issues, as well as innovating protective mechanisms.

Research Summary 

TODDE is a cybersecurity research project focused on developing personalized deception strategies to proactively defend against cyber attacks. By analyzing attacker personality traits, TODDE predicts their next moves and deploys customized deception tactics, such as AI-powered honeypots that adaptively respond to attacker behavior, making the deception more realistic and effective. This dynamic framework combines psychological insights, advanced AI, and machine learning to enhance cybersecurity defenses through targeted, adaptive deception. 


### Easton Kelso 

Research Summary 

We are working to unveil the privacy and security hurdles within the education technology (edtech) landscape in regards to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The first stretch of research has uncovered the challenges that HEIs face during the acquisition process of these edtechs.
Our first study, uncovered the EdTech acquisition process in the HEI context including the consideration of security and privacy issues throughout that process, the pain points of HEI personnel in establishing adequate protection mechanisms in service contracts, and their struggle in holding vendors accountable due to a lack of visibility into their system and power-asymmetry, among other reasons.
Continued research involves understanding the differing technologies that faculty use at HEIs that are unsanctioned by their institutions to uncover any privacy and security concerns that are involved.

Research Summary 

We are developing an automated pipeline that interacts with Android applications while monitoring their behavior. Our research provides more granular insight than prior works into how apps access and transmit users' sensitive data. Additionally, we aim to investigate whether apps handle user information differently across various geolocations.

Title: Perceptions of Fairness and Privacy in AI-Driven Recruitment and Education: Examining the Use of Candidate Attributes in Algorithmic Decision Making

Summary: This research project investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recruitment and education, focusing on fairness, transparency, and potential biases. We examine how AI-driven decision-making processes rely on candidate and student attributes, such as demographics, personality traits, and physiological characteristics, and the concerns this raises regarding appropriateness, relevance, and privacy.
Objectives
Investigate perceptions of AI-driven decision-making in recruitment and education
Identify concerns regarding fairness, bias, and privacy
Inform ethical AI practices and policy discussions
Impact
Contribute to responsible AI deployment in recruitment and education
Foster trust and inclusive practices
Inform policy decisions on AI regulation and governance
