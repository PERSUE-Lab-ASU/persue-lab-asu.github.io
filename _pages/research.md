## Privacy and Security of Technology Ecosystems at Higher Education Institutes
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/projects/edtech-slide.png" height="250" style="float:right"/>
Higher education institutes (HEIs) are quickly becoming complex ecosystems of various computing technologies handling diverse data pertaining to teaching, research, lifestyles and mobility in campus, health and finances, and immigration status. These technologies and services are provided by, in most cases, third-party for-profit vendors, and their integration creates complex ecosystems that often lack transparency and auditability, as identified in our recent paper. 
This opaque collection of systems, and data flows among them, which can not be monitored by HEI personnel, creates a lot of opportunities for privacy invasion as well as safety and welbeing of the data subjects. Simultenously, the massive amounts of data these technologies collect are making HEis lucrative targets for cyber attackers.
Our research is sheding light on this emerging problems through qualitative explorations, as well as developing tools and frameworks for identifying and quantifying privacy and security issues, as well as innovating protective mechanisms.

**Methods:** interviews and surveys, system development on mobile and web platforms, statistical analysis. 

## Deception-based Proactive Defense to Prevent Cyberattacks

Coordinated cyber attackers are increasingly employing sophisticated techniques and tactics to compromize critical infrastructures. Current preventive mechanisms are most often reactive and creates too many false positive alarms. Recent research has recognized the critical need for proactive defense mechanisms that can *prevent an attack from succeeding*. Deception-based defense, that attemts to mislead the attackers to waste their time and resources, and simultaneously learns more about their attack strategy to strengthen the defense ssytem, are among the most promising approaches to proactive defese. We are building the next generation deception mechanisms that will dynamically adapt to the attacker's attack strategy. By analyzing attacker personality traits, TODDE predicts their next moves and deploys customized deception tactics, such as AI-powered honeypots that adaptively respond to attacker behavior, making the deception more realistic and effective. This dynamic framework combines psychological insights, advanced AI, and machine learning to enhance cybersecurity defenses through targeted, adaptive deception. 

**Methods**: causal machine learning, system development for real attack-based experiments, cognitive psychology.

## Interdependent privacy

Digital technologies collect massive amounts of data *from people who are not the users*. These include wearable, sensor-rich devices such as augmented or virtual reality camras, headsets, or glasses that record people continously around them, voice assistants, as well as applications running on mobile devices that collect, e.g., phone numbers of other people. All these data can be used in ways that threaten he privacy and safety of the data subjects, including tracking their activities and location, stalking and harassment, and fraud and identity theft. This project aims to innovate socio-technical systems and methods for responsible use of technology and minimizing the harms to other people.

**Methods:** modeling human decision-making, cognitive and behavioral sciene, user studies, mobile app development.
