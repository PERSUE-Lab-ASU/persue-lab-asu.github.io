### We aim to enhance the privacy, security, and reliability of computing technologies.

Our research activities identify and understand privacy, security, and reliability issues with information technologies and explore mitigation strategies toward a safer technology ecosystem. 

We take a human-centered perspective to understand the problem space while combining techniques from **AI and Machine Learning**, **Internet Measurement**, **Cognitive Psychology**, and **Statistical Causal Inference methodologies** to solve the identified problems.
