## PhD Students

![Syed Zami-Ul-Haque Navid](../img/navid.jpg){: style="max-width: 15%; height: auto;"}
**Syed Zami-Ul-Haque Navid**  
PhD Researcher  
**Email:** snavid2@asu.edu  
**Education:** PhD at Arizona State University

**Research:** I am developing an automated pipeline that interacts with Android applications while monitoring their behavior. Our research provides more granular insight than prior works into how apps access and transmit users' sensitive data. Additionally, we aim to investigate whether apps handle user information differently across various geolocations.

**Khalid Alasiri**  
PhD Researcher  
**Email:** kalasir1@asu.edu  
**Education:** PhD at Arizona State University

**Research:** I am working to develop proactive cyber defense mechanisms that will dynamically adapt to the attacker's behaviors and attack strategy.

**Wesley Kwan**

PhD Researcher 

**Education:** PhD at Arizona State University

**Research:** Previously, I researched ways to predict hacker behavior for cyber-threat intelligence by designing systems to collect and analyze data from forums and marketplaces on the dark web. At PERSUE Lab, I aim to uncover and understand mechanisms behind the decisions of digital actors through causal machine learning, particularly as it pertains to user privacy and system security.

## Undergraduate Students

![Easton Kelso](../img/easton_kelso.jpg){: style="max-width: 15%; height: auto;"}
**Easton Kelso**  
Undergraduate Researcher  
**Email:** eakelso@asu.edu  
**Education:** Undergraduate at Arizona State University

**Research:** I am researching to unveil the privacy and security hurdles within the education technology (edtech) landscape in regards to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The first stretch of research has uncovered the challenges that HEIs face during the acquisition process of these edtechs. Our first study, uncovered the EdTech acquisition process in the HEI context including the consideration of security and privacy issues throughout that process, the pain points of HEI personnel in establishing adequate protection mechanisms in service contracts, and their struggle in holding vendors accountable due to a lack of visibility into their system and power-asymmetry, among other reasons. Continued research involves understanding the differing technologies that faculty use at HEIs that are unsanctioned by their institutions to uncover any privacy and security concerns that are involved.

**Email:** apanda13@asu.edu  
**Education:** Undergraduate at Arizona State University

**Bio and Research interest**: I am a Computer Science Junior at Arizona State University, part of the Barrett Honors College and the Grand Challenges Scholar Program. Being passionate about AI, I focus on human-robot interactions, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. As a National Master in chess, I have honed my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Representing my chess team from middle school to now has strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and decision-making abilities under pressure.
