# Undergraduate research

We have been lucky to have many opportunities to involve undergraduate students in practical research. Over the years, they have contributed to the research mission of this lab: making technology safer, reliable, and trustworthy for end users. In many cases, this was their first hands-on experience in research, and we are proud to say that, as part of our lab, many have published (and continue to publish) research papers at top-tier security and privacy venues ([see publication page](https://persue-lab-asu.github.io/publications/)). More, this research experience encouraged them to pursue graduate studies.
