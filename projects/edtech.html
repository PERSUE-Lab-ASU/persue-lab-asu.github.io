  <h3>Privacy, Security, and Safety issues in Education Technology</h3>
  <p class="mb-50">Education technologies (EdTech) are being integrated into every step of educational processes. As the Covid-19 pandemic precluded in-person interactions, schools had to rely even more on technologies to deliver education. The vast amount of data being collected, analyzed, and shared by EdTech may pose significant threats to users' privacy, safety, and security. We direct research efforts toward unveiling and quantifying the threats they pose to the users and inventing mitigation mechanisms.</p>
