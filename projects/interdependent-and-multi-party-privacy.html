  <h3>Interdependent and multi-party privacy</h3>
  <p class="mb-100">Many technologies facilitate, and even encourage, the collection and sharing of data about people other than their users, raising a plethora of privacy issues for the data subjects.
    <br/><br/>For example, online sharing of visual data recorded at public places (e.g., by traditional, mobile, or wearable cameras and AR/VR devices) reveals the identity, location, and other sensitive information about the surrounding people, including uninvolved bystanders. Smart home cameras survey domestic workers and guests, and drones and autonomous vehicles record all people in the street. In a nutshell, it is becoming increasingly difficult for people who are not technology users to protect their data from being exposed. 
    <br/><br/>The collected data can be used for profiling and targeting for advertisement, surveillance, and even online and physical harassment, potentially threatening privacy, autonomy, and safety of a vast number of people. At a collective level, public access to such massive datasets can be abused to create national crises (e.g., the Cambridge Analytica scandal).
    <br/><br/>Our research aim is to understand technology users' behaviors related to the collection, use, or dissemination of other people's information, determining interventions to encourage privacy-respecting behaviors.</p>
