**Our team is growing! We are looking for teammates interested in doing a PhD focusing on privacy or security.**

Below are some reasons why you might consider coming here:
  
- Research is inherently a collaborative process. Being in the right environment among the right people can benefit you immensely to generate, curate, and revise ideas, by incorporating feedback from peers who come from diverse backgrounds. ASU creates such environments through organizations (such as [Cybersecurity and Trusted Foundations](https://globalsecurity.asu.edu/expertise/cybersecurity-and-trusted-foundations/) under [Global Security Initiative](https://globalsecurity.asu.edu) where researchers from multiple disciplines come together and tackle important, complex, and timely problems.
- My research is focused on solving security/privacy issues of technology, but highly multidisciplinary, touching CS, Cognitive Psychology, Computational Social Science, Network Measurement, and HCI. If your research area intersects with this set, there should be a research problem that you would find interesting and engaging, two very important factors for succeeding in a PhD program.
- Weather is a very important element for good quality of living. Arizona has very pleasant temperatures throughout the year; it does get very hot in the summer, but only for ~2 months. No snow, little rain, always sunshine.
- Another factor for a good life IMO is access to good food. Being very close to Phoenix (~15 min drive), one of the largest cities in the USA, it provides easy access to international cuisine and grocery stores.
- Arizona is an incredibly beautiful state, and surrounded by other beautiful states (Utah, Colorado, California). You can visit amazing national parks within a few hours of drive.
- I consider myself as a proponent of work life balance in academia, and will try my best to make the PhD journey enjoyable and fulfilling to my students.
  
If you are a masters or undergraduate student and interested in getting research experience, you are also welcome to join us.

*All prospective students, please email your resume, transcripts, and a short description of your research interest and how that aligns with the goals of our lab to rakibul.hasan@asu.edu*.
