Hi, I'm Junichi Koizumi, a senior majoring in Computer Science. My current research focuses on privacy concerns in AI-based recruitment, blending cutting-edge technology with ethical considerations. Outside of academics, I'm an adventure enthusiast â€“ you'll find me lifting weights, exploring underwater worlds through scuba diving, carving up slopes while snowboarding, or cheering at baseball games.
