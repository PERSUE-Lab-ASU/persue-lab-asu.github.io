### Privacy on social platforms

We are moving toward a more technology-driven society where everything is getting more connected and social experiences are being recreated in the virtual space. As these technologies enter our private life, protecting sensitive data was never more critical. Through a concerted effort, we are working toward building usable, intelligent, and adaptive privacy-enhancing technology, and designing behavioral interventions to encourage the adoption of those tools.
