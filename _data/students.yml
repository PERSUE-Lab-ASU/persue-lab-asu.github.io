  research: >
    I am developing an automated pipeline that interacts with Android applications while monitoring their behavior. Our research provides more granular insight than prior works into how apps access and transmit usersâ€™ sensitive data. Additionally, we aim to investigate whether apps handle user information differently across various geolocations.
